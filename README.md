# EveningClinicTeleVisitAnalysis

Some time ago, for our evening clinic (visits after 5:30pm) we explored the idea of providing telephone visits as an alternative to a face-to-face visit to patients to improve service.  We felt that this would be a more convenient alternative for the patient to get their medical needs met without having to come in.  Attached is about 6 months worth of visits, which includes the telephone encounters.  After we implemented the program, we wanted to use the visit data to determine how to staff for the evening appointments and evaluate the effectiveness of the program.
